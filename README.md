# ðŸ§  GitTales â€” Automated AI-Powered Release Documentation

## Description

GitTales automates release note generation by analyzing Git changes and creating detailed, AI-generated Markdown
summaries for every release.

Whenever a Pull Request is merged, a **GitHub Action** automatically triggers and sends repository and branch data to
the **GitTales backend**.  
The backend then uses **SimpleGit** to extract the Git diff between branches and sends it to an **OpenAI agent**, which
translates raw code changes into clear, human-readable technical summaries.  
These summaries are formatted as Markdown documents, stored in the database, and can be viewed, downloaded, or shared
directly.

Developers can:

- Log in with GitHub to browse repositories and generated documentation.
- Access the same experience through the **web app** or the **VS Code extension**.
- Keep release documentation consistent, effortless, and AI-driven â€” all in just a few clicks.
